    "At the end of this exercise you should be able to work with some basic Machine Learning concepts, and implement and evaluate a learning-based approach to playing Schnapsen. In this notebook we are going to create an adaptive bot. We will use the principle discussed in the machine learning lecture, but now in an agent setting. This comes down to using basic hill-climbing search, but learn the heuristic function rather than implementing it. This will require a few basic ingredients:\n",

    "> Script that plays games between existing bots and creates a dataset to learn from. The dataset contains each observed state, labeled with the (eventual) winner of the game. See the script train-ml-bot.py.<br>\n",
    "> A function that translates a state object to a feature vector. See the function features(...) in ml.py<br>\n",
    "> An implementation with a hill-climbing bot that gets its heuristic from a machine learning model. See bots/ml/ml.py \n",

    "Follow this Notebook step-by-step. For this course it is necessary that you manipulate the python programmes we provide. You can do the exercises in any Programming Editor of your liking. Still, please fill in the questions in this notebook as usual. You can also run tournaments in it if you want, but running them in your editor or via the commandline seems much more convenient. \n",

    "As was mentioned, the assignment is graded as pass/fail. To pass you need to have either a full working code or an explanation of what you tried and what didn't work for the tasks that you were unable to complete (you can use multi-line comments or a text cell).\n"

    "The plan is as follows: we run the train-ml-bot.py script, which creates a model for us, and places it in the bots/ml directory. All you need to do is to is to complete the feature extraction method in bots/ml/ml.py It returns a basic feature vector modelling the properties of the game state, or more precisely the bot’s perspective of the game state (which means that in phase 1 of the game there are parts of the feature values unknown (for the cards that are either in the adversaries hands or in the pile). \n",

    "To run the bots using the commandline/terminal:\n",
    "    - If you want to play 2 bots against each other, e.g. rand and bully: python play.py -1 rand -2 bully\n",
    "    - To see what other options there are: python play.py --help\n",
    "    - If you run python tournament.py it'll play a round-robin tournament between bully, rand and rdeep where every pair of players play 10 matches. Run python tournament.py --help to see how you can change the players, and the number of games played (if needed).\n",

    "### Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Fill in the missing code (all the '???' lines) and run a number of games to check whether your agent \"works\". You can either run the play.py script in a command line, or copy the play code from one of the previous notebooks here (do not forget to import all the necessary modules and code). \n",
